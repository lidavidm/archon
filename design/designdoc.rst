:Author: David Li

After the fall of the Cordelian Empire three centuries ago, no strong ruler
has emerged to reunite the now-peaceful Heartland of the former
nation. However, the ambitious, yet cruel young emperor of the Kingdom of
Jemima has begun a terrorizing campaign of conquest throughout the
land. One of his victims is the small Kingdom of Marcellus and its
inhabitants, of which at least one swears revenge for her injuries.
